Welcome to my website. I am a digital humanist looking at literary spaces in the context of Iberian minoritised languages and cultures, particularly through the use of text-mining and GIS to map post-war Catalan literary and cultural heritage. I am also interested in computer-assisted text analysis and the use of digital technologies to enhance learning and teaching. 


I currently hold a full time teaching position at the [Department of Spanish, Portuguese and Latin American Studies](https://www.ucc.ie/en/splas/), University College Cork, where I also collaborate with the [Department of Digital Humanities](https://www.ucc.ie/en/dah/) and have recently completed my PhD entitled [*Mapping the works of Manuel de Pedrolo in relation to the post-civil war Catalan landscape*](https://cora.ucc.ie/handle/10468/8959) (2019). 

I am the co-director of [DHSI Atlantic](http://dhsiatlantic.ucc.ie), a Digital Humanities Summer Institute at University College Cork, Ireland. (2020 - )
