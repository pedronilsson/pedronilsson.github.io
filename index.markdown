Welcome to my website. I am a lecturer in Digital Humanities at the [Department of Digital Arts and Humanities](https://www.ucc.ie/en/dah/) at University College Cork. My research looks at literary spaces in the context of Iberian minoritised languages and cultures, particularly through the use of text-mining and GIS to map post-war Catalan literary and cultural heritage. I am also interested in multilingual approaches to the field of Digital Humanities, sustainability and the maker community, and the enhancing of learning and teaching through the ethical use of digital technologies.


I preside the [Associaci√≥ d'Humanitats Digitals Catalanes](http://adhcat.org), a private non-profit organization created with the aim of promoting digital scholarship and best practices within the field of Catalan Studies.
