Welcome to my website. I am a digital humanist looking at literary spaces in the context of Iberian minoritised languages and cultures, particularly GIS approaches to post-war Catalan literature. I am also interested in computer-assisted text analysis and the use of digital technologies in learning and teaching. 


I currently hold a full time teaching position at the [Department of Spanish, Portuguese and Latin American Studies](https://www.ucc.ie/en/splas/), University College Cork, where I also collaborate with the [Department of Digital Humanities](https://www.ucc.ie/en/dah/) and have recently completed my PhD (2019). 

I am the co-director of [DHSI Atlantic](http://dhsiatlantic.ucc.ie), a Digital Humanities Summer Institute at University College Cork, Ireland. (2020 - )
